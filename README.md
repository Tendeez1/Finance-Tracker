# Finance Tracker  

This project is a Finance Tracker written in **C** with **SQLite** integration to manage personal finances. While this project could have been implemented more easily in Python, it was developed in C to challenge myself and improve my skills in combining low-level programming with database management.  

## Features  
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in functionality to ensure secure access.  
- **Add Transactions**: Record income and expenses with details such as amount, category, and date.
