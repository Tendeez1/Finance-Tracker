Hello! I'm Tommy Pham, and this is my GitHub portfolio where I showcase projects that reflect my passion for coding and problem-solving. Here you'll find a collection of personal projects, with a focus around C and Python.

Feel free to explore my repositories, dive into the code, and check out what I've been working on. Iâ€™m always learning and experimenting with new technologies, so stay tuned for more updates!
